Summary: How to find data in the NHL API

So I decided to retake my NHL API video to try to improve things (now that I know how to get my audio better) and maybe make it a little easier to digest. Turns out even a 3 and a half minute video takes hours to get just right and somehow I still am not totally satisfied with it. I think perhaps this may be something I spend more time on in the near future to try to provide people with a little bit of educational material. In the meantime feel free to go have a watch of Finding Data in the NHL API over on Odysee
