Summary: trying to get back in the habit of regular updates

Finally got around to setting everything back up again to push updates, one day I will just write something to auto-update when I push, but until then I guess
I am left with following my own notes when I want to publish content again.  Currently working on a few neat side projects including a friendly python plugin system
for chat bots (ie discord, slack, matrix, etc).  Its super early on that project however so its not even ready for a demo yet but its been a learning experience every 
step of the way so far which is great.
