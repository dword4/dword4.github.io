# About me
Semi-professional nerd working currently in the DevOps space but I have done traditional systems admin, cloud engineering and all manner of other roles inbetween.
I write Python a lot, Terraform a little and every now and then Ansible or Chef.  When I am not napping, coding or otherwise working I probably am thinking about code/naps or trying 
to keep up with yard work.
