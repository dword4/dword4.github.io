    <p>For a while now I have struggled to develop the <a href="http://gitlab.com/dword4/hockey-info">hockey-info</a> project further, trying to make it faster or more friendly for mobile use.  I dabbled with new frameworks to make a faster interface, pondered the idea of turning it into an <span class="caps">API</span> and learning <span class="caps">JS</span> to put a more stylish interface in front of it.  Even put time into moving some of the more cumbersome <span class="caps">API</span> hits into redisJSON objects for the sake of&nbsp;speed. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I had the local version configured to use Redis that I realized I would have to pay more to run it on the internet, and after some research I realized that it would more than double the cost from 5$ a month to about 20 to 25$ a month depending on where I decided to host it.  There are some hosted Redis options that would have simplified the process but they were the most expensive, when I looked at doing most of the configruation by hand it saved me money but added more complexity that I wasn&#8217;t really interested&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Realizing I had hit the wall of a reasonable hobby project, going from 60$ a year to well over 240$ was something I could not justify.  I had pondered ways to try to monetize things but they fell flat when I looked at actual traffic numbers.  The users were simply not there to run any sort of advertising and without actual users nobody would donate to such a project either to keep it online.  With the financial realities staring at me from a spreadsheet and the difficulty of writing actual code to move the project forward I decided it was time to hang it&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>I started the project in March of 2019 almost a year after I had begun documenting the <span class="caps">NHL</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, taking all the things I learned along the way and creating someting to show for all my efforts.  In more than a few job interviews I talked about the project, how I had grown it and shaped it into something I used almost daily. It was great fun to grow the application with new features, fixing the various quirks that showed up during the Covid-19 shortened season as the <span class="caps">NHL</span> altered playoff formats.  But as with so many things it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to put money into hosting it when there are so many better applications out there doing the same&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>While it is kind of bittersweet to sunset a project like this I think it will eventually free up some mental resources to put into something new and exciting that hopefully will force me to learn some new languages and techniques along the&nbsp;way.</p>
